# Contracts

In this folder we have code specific to the [ink!](https://use.ink/) language to pre-process smart contracts written in this sub-set of Rust to a form that is compatible with `coq-of-rust`. We also provide a few examples extracted from the [test suite](https://github.com/formal-land/ink/tree/e5f61827de64bbba3ecc17c6006497577d21b013/integration-tests) of the ink!.
