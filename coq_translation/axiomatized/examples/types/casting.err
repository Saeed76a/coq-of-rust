8 |     let integer: u8 = decimal;
  |                  --   ^^^^^^^ expected `u8`, found `f32`
  |                  |
  |                  expected due to this

error[E0604]: only `u8` can be cast as `char`, not `f32`

17 |     let character = decimal as char;
   |                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ invalid cast
   |
help: try `char::from_u32` instead (via a `u32`)
