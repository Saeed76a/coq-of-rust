# Move compiler in Coq

In this repository we put the translation of the Move compiler, as well as simulations and proofs we make on it.

We translate the code from the original Rust code using `coq-of-rust` from the branch https://github.com/formal-land/move/pull/1 This is not yet in the CI, and we maintain the translation manually.
